# Employee Management System - Python Project

This is a simple **Employee Management System** built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in **Python**. This project was developed after completing the first module of my **Python Full Stack Development Course** to practice and implement concepts like classes, objects, constructors, getters, setters, and basic control flow.

## 📌 Project Description

The Employee Management System allows you to:
- Add new employee details
- View the complete list of employees
- Search employee details by name
- Update employee information

It uses two classes:
1. **`Employee`** - Handles individual employee data with getter and setter methods.
2. **`EmpDetails`** - Manages the list of all employees and performs operations like add, display, search, and update.
